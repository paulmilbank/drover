# Drover Task Template
# Use this template to create high-quality, actionable tasks

title: "Specific Component/Feature Name - Action Verb"
description: |
  Detailed description of what needs to be done.

  Include:
  - Target files/packages (e.g., packages/components/src/button/)
  - Specific action (create/update/fix/test/refactor)
  - Technical details (function names, feature flags, file paths)
  - Acceptance criteria (how to verify it works)

# Example good tasks:

# Example 1: Specific component update
title: "Add New York variant to Button component"
description: |
  Create packages/components/src/button/new_york.rs with:
  - New York theme styling (smaller border-radius, muted colors)
  - Same props API as default variant
  - Consistent with other New York variants
  Tests in packages/components/src/button/new_york_tests.rs

# Example 2: Bug fix
title: "Fix memory leak in DatePicker on unmount"
description: |
  In packages/components/src/datepicker/default.rs:
  - Add Drop impl for DatePickerState to clean up closures
  - Verify no dangling refs using cargo +nightly leak
  - Add test in datepicker_tests.rs for proper cleanup

# Example 3: Test addition
title: "Add E2E tests for ComboBox keyboard navigation"
description: |
  Create tests/e2e/combobox-keyboard.spec.ts covering:
  - Arrow up/down navigation
  - Enter to select
  - Escape to close
  - Tab to focus trap
  Uses Playwright API with browser context

# Example 4: Feature implementation
title: "Implement lazy loading for Chart components"
description: |
  Add behind [feature = "lazy-charts"] flag:
  - packages/components/src/chart/lazy_loader.rs
  - Dynamically import chart only when visible
  - Reduce initial bundle by ~150KB
  - Add loading spinner placeholder

# Example 5: Documentation
title: "Document ComboBox API differences from Select"
description: |
  In packages/components/src/combobox/README.md:
  - Compare with Select component
  - Highlight free-text filtering capability
  - Show custom rendering examples
  - List all props with TypeScript signatures
